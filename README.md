# qExchanger
I compiled the program for ease of use. To run it, find the .exe in ```./qExchanger``` and execute it<br>
<br>
EDIT: Right now, the compiled program is out of date. In the coming days I will compile it to the latest varsion.For latest and greatest, download the source code and run it.<br>
<br>
Dependencies: ```PyQt5 5.13.2``` ```requests```
